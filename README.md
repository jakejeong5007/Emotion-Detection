# Emotion-Detection
Generally, people tend to have a 70% rate of recognizing other people's emotions. 
Emotion detection can show more than a verbal and physical feedback which can help in improving online courses, video games, and help people communicate with others.

# How it Works
The model first detects the portion of the face from the image. It then makes facial landmarks on the face which can be end of mouth, nose and hairlines. By calculating the distance between the facial landmarks, it outputs the guessed emotion that the person is feeling.
